### I. What is iDesign about
iDesign is an augmented reality Interior design app intended to help users to digitally display
different furniture items using Augmented Reality, before deciding to buy the items for their
home. Augmented reality essentially blends objects such as sofas, tables and other furnishings
in the virtual world and lays them over the real world of a consumer’s living room or bedroom as
viewed through a smartphone or in-store tablet.

This app will save the user’s time as you don’t need to go to the store and spend the entire day
looking at different furniture and regret buying it. Before buying, buyers can view how the
product looks like on wall, table on their phone iDesign by using AR technology. The benefits
are clear, for everyone involved: less hassle, less travel, quicker and more intuitive
understanding of how a space will look and feel.
