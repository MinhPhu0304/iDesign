iDesign is an augmented reality Interior design app intended to help users to digitally display
different furniture items using Augmented Reality, before deciding to buy the items for their

viewed through a smartphone or in-store tablet.

This app will save the user’s time as you don’t need to go to the store and spend the entire day
looking at different furniture and regret buying it. Before buying, buyers can view how the
product looks like on wall, table on their phone iDesign by using AR technology. The benefits

understanding of how a space will look and feel.
